Hey, I want to build an educational app for a coffee shop. It's about the drinks that are made at the shop. All the Barista should have a source of truth on how each drink is made.

The current idea is to have a simple app that categorizes drinks into black, milk, non coffee and other. In each category, all the drinks of that category are listed.

The drinks have different requirements. They all will get a video that is hosted either at YouTube or Vimeo and also show which type of cup should be used. Otherwise, each drink can be very different.

From the technical perspective, the whole app should be totally lean and very easy to maintain. This means I want to use vanilla JS, css3, no frameworks and ideally no libraries. For the point of configuration, I want no database. I rather imagine a YAML file where all the categories with all the drinks and all the instructions on how to make the drink are listed. Here I want to leave a note: The app should handle the list of attributes for each drink dynamically, so no matter what's listed it will show as a data list/data sheet to that drink. Also set up the app as a PWA.

From the design perspective, I would like to have as a start screen a tile grid of the categories. When clicking on a tile of a category, the user gets to a new screen with a tile grid of the drinks. When clicking on a drink, the user should see the data sheet of the drink. Ideally as a bottom sheet, like in material design3.
